Offline AI Attendance System

This project is an AI-powered offline attendance system that automatically marks attendance using a web camera and face recognition.
It eliminates the need for manual attendance and works without any internet connection.

The system detects faces in real time through a webcam, recognizes registered students, and records their attendance automatically in a CSV file.
